            <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I'm Marine! As you can probably tell, I took some time choosing a photo of myself. I hope I made the right choice. Regardless, I'm 26 and I live in LA! I moved to live here 2.5 years ago from Yerevan, Armenia. I have a degree in communications and linguistics and another one in public administration. My work portfolio, however, has been developing in the direction of management so far. I worked with a team of international lawyers in Yerevan for 3 years, then moved here and worked as a floor manager at a company specializing in interior design. Now I work as a web-admin / social media manager at an e-commerce company. Pretty diverse, I know, but it's been incredibly revealing in terms of finding what I really want to do and what makes me wake up in the morning and say "I can't wait to smell my coffee" instead of "I need my coffee, don't talk to me!". And what I really want to do is create!</p>
            
                <p>In my free time I enjoy watching movies, going to yoga, reading and going to the beach. I really want to try bodyboarding because it looks as fun as surfboarding but unlike surfboarding, it looks like it requires zero effort to stand up and try not to fall. My favorite movie directors are Tim Burton, Jim Jarmusch, Quentin Tarantino and Kim Ki Duk. My dream is to travel the world which I've still seen very little of. From where I've been so far, one of my favorite cities is Prague in Czech Republic.</p>
